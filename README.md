Code challenges and data structures and algorithms for Codefellows 401 Java course.

# Day 1: Reverse an Array

The challenge asked us to reverse an array. It gave us the option to either reverse the array in place or create a new reversed array. We came up with solutions to both.

[Summary](docs/array-reverse.md) for the first code challenge.

# Day 2: Arrays, loops, and unit testing

Code challenge two asks us to insert an element into the middle of an array. [Summary](docs/array-shift.md) of our second code challenge.

# Day 3: Binary search

The third code challenge asks us to implement the classic binary search algorithm on a sorted list of `int`s. [Details](docs/binary-search.md) on the third code challenge.

# Day 4: Linked List

We implement a basic linked list class with just a few instance methods. This class will get fleshed out more later. [Details](docs/linked-list.md) on the linked list class.
