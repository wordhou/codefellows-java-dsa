Code challenges and data structures and algorithms for Codefellows 401 Java course.

# Day 1: Reverse an Array

The challenge asked us to reverse an array. It gave us the option to either reverse the array in place or create a new
reversed array. We came up with solutions to both.

[Summary](docs/array-reverse.md) for the first code challenge.

# Day 2: Arrays, loops, and unit testing

Code challenge two asks us to insert an element into the middle of an array. [Summary](docs/array-shift.md) of our
second code challenge.

# Day 3: Binary search

The third code challenge asks us to implement the classic binary search algorithm on a sorted list of `int`
s. [Details](docs/binary-search.md) on the third code challenge.

# Day 5: Linked List

We implement a basic linked list class with just a few instance methods. This class will get fleshed out more
later. [Details](docs/linked-list.md) on the linked list class.

# Day 6: Insertion and Deletion in LinkedLists

We build on the linked list class from day 5 and add insertion and deletion to the API.

# Day 7: Indexing from beginning and end in LinkedList

We continue building on the linked list class and implement a way to access elements by index.

# Day 10: Stacks and Queues implementations

We defined the interface for a stack and a queue and implement both classes using linked lists. Details on the [stacks and queues labs](docs/stacks-queues.md).

# Day 11: Implementing a Queue with Two Stacks

Our challenge was to implement a Queue using two Stacks.

# Day 12: Implementing a Specialized Queue

Our challenge is to implement a queue that accepts elements of different types, allowing us to dequeue the item of a specific type that's been in the queue the longest, and allowing us to dequeue the item of any time that's been in the queue for the longest.

# Day 13: Matching brackets with a stack

We use a stack to implement a solution to the matching brackets problem, where we validate whether or not the brackets in a string are matching and balanced.

# Day 14: Implementing a binary tree and binary search tree

In this [series](docs/binary-trees.md) of challenges we're asked to implement various implementations of and algorithms on binary trees. We define a class of binary trees and implement several methods to traverse over the binary tree. Then we extend this class to create a binary search tree, adding insertion and search methods.
